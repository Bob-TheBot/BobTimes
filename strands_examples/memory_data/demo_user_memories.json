When I searched for information, I encountered conflicting and potentially false search results claiming Charlie Kirk had been shot or died, with inconsistent dates and information that appeared unreliable. I was unable to verify these claims and advised the user to check reliable news sources instead. The user then asked me to remember what happened to Charlie, suggesting they may have more information or want me to remember this interaction.",
